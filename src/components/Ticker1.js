 Built for Dark Mode: Most templates are built using light colors and later on adapted to dark colors. Dark themes shouldn’t be an afterthought, they should be a top priority.
Designer Friendly: Speed up the prototyping phase by using a highly configurable Design System. Collaborate easily by taking advantage of a carefully crafted Figma file.
Great Developer Experience: Don’t worry about class names, just use the Visual Studio Code snippets. You can take advantage of autocomplete and also access the entire documentation right from your code editor.  </Marquee>
